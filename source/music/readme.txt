1989 Chaste Tris Music License

The only thing in this game that is not my creation is the music which was obtained freely from OverClocked ReMix and GameChops.

According to my understanding of the terms in the OC Remix FAQ and in the GameChops video descriptions, I am allowed to use the songs as long as I give proper credits.

As such, I intend to mention them in every video I create showing the gameplay with the music being used. In fact, if I have not included credit anywhere it is most likely a technical limitation such as Tiktok or Instagram not allowing me to add long descriptions. But where possible I will give credit to the source. Also I may forget to add credits while I am uploading demo videos to multiple sites but as soon as I get comments asking me where the songs are from I will be able to edit the videos and add the proper credits.

Below are the links where you can find more information about the songs I chose for this game:
